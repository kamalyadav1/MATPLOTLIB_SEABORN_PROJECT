Data Visualization Dashboards 
This project is a collection of data dashboards created with Python. It shows how to turn raw numbers into clear, professional charts using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

📁 What’s Inside?
1. Business Success Dashboard
Shows which industries (like IT or Retail) have the most successful businesses using colorful bar charts.

2. Hospital Earnings Dashboard
Visualizes how much money different hospital departments make. It focuses on clean labels and professional financial scaling.

3. Human Development Index (HDI) Analysis
Compares different countries to see who is leading in development. It uses both bar charts for rankings and line plots to show trends.

4. Entertainment Distribution Dashboard
A simple pie chart that shows the split between Movies and TV Shows on streaming platforms.

5. Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
A detailed view of road safety. It compares the number of accidents versus the number of deaths using a mix of bar, line, and pie charts.

 Tools Used
Python: The main language.

Pandas & NumPy: For organizing the data.
